About our Curricula


### Ecology
This workshop covers data organization with spreadsheets, data cleaning with OpenRefine, and some data analysis and plotting (with your choice of R or Python). This workshop is intended for anyone working with tabular data (data with rows and columns). The data used for this workshop is an ecology dataset - counts of animal species that were observed in different locations over time, along with information about their sex, weight, etc. This data is easily understandable by non-ecologists and is considered our most general-purpose workshop. 

### Social Sciences
This workshop covers data organization with spreadsheets, data cleaning with OpenRefine, and some data analysis and plotting with R. This workshop is very similar to our Ecology workshop, but uses a dataset more relevant for social scientists, particularly those working with interview data. The data used for this workshop is a set of interview responses from interviews of farmers in two countries in eastern Africa about their agricultural practices and household resources. This workshop uses restricted-response data and does not cover qualitative data analysis or analysis of free-text responses.


...and so on.
