<p>The Carpentries develops and teaches in-person, interactive, hands-on, two-day workshops for learning core data science and coding skills. Carpentries workshops are
taught by volunteer [Instructors]({% link pages/instructors.html %}), [trained in pedagogy](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/), who focus on creating a motivating and engaging environment for learners. All our lessons are open source, hosted on
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, and collaboratively developed by our volunteer community. </p>

<p>A global team of <a href="{% link pages/regional_coordinators.html %}">Regional Coordinators</a> support the coordination of workshop activity and community building in regions around the world. </p>
