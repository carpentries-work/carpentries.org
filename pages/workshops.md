<p>The Carpentries develops and teaches in-person, interactive, hands-on, two-day workshops for learning core data science and coding skills. Carpentries workshops are
taught by volunteer [Instructors]({% link pages/instructors.html %}), [trained in pedagogy](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/), who focus on creating a motivating and engaging environment for learners. All our lessons are open source, hosted on
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, and collaboratively developed by our volunteer community. </p>

<p>A global team of our [Regional Coordinators][regional_coordinators] support the coordination of workshop activity and community building in regions around the world. </p>

<p>
Check out our <a href="/upcoming_workshops/">upcoming</a> and <a href="/past_workshops/">past</a> workshops.

### <i class="far fa-money-bill-alt" id="workshop-cost"></i> Workshop Cost

Our instructors are volunteers, and so are not paid for their teaching, but host sites are **required to cover travel and accommodation costs for any instructors**.

* The cost of hosting a workshop includes both the Workshop Administration Fee and travel expenses for the two instructors.
* The Workshop Administration fee is used to support staff time with this partnership. You will be provided with exceptional and timely customer service in addition to around the clock support for your workshop. 

#### Workshop Administration Fee (Government and non-profit institutions):
* $2500 US

#### Workshop Administration Fee (For Profit):
* For information on fees for for-profit organisations, please [contact us](mailto:team@carpentries.org). 50% of workshop coordination fees for for-profit organisations go towards supporting workshops in areas with financial need. Partial or full waivers for fees will be considered on an as-needed basis.

All invoices will be issued by [Community Initiatives](https://communityin.org/), our fiscal sponsor. The Carpentries staff will work with host sites to manage the invoicing process.

#### Workshop Administration Scholarship
Scholarships may be available for workshops that reach new or under-served communities. If you are interested in hosting and would like to request assistance covering the fee, please complete the [Workshop Request Form][workshop_request_form]. Select the option “I am requesting a scholarship to waive the administrative fee” and answer the required questions. If a scholarship is awarded, the host will still be responsible for the instructor travel expenses. 

#### Travel Expenses for Instructors:
* All Instructors are volunteers, but the Host needs to cover their travel expenses. We work to find local instructors, but suggest that you estimate about $2000 total ($1000 per Instructor) for the travel, food, and accommodation of the instructors. 
* The details of how you will reimburse the instructors need to be established when the workshop is scheduled. **The Carpentries is not involved in this process.**

### <i class="fas fa-tasks"></i> Organizing a Workshop

The Carpentries offers 2 types of workshops. **Centrally-Organised** and **Self-Organised**.

#### Requesting a Centrally-Organised Workshop
Workshops are organised by The Carpentries Workshop Administration team for a [fee](#workshop-cost). The [Regional Coordinator][regional_coordinators] for your region will assist with locating and coordinating instructors for the workshop. We ask that you request Centrally-Organised workshops at least 2-3 months before your desired workshop date. To learn more about the process for organising a workshop please review the [Workshop Checklist][workshop_checklist].

</div>


#### Notification of Self-Organised Workshops
The Carpentries welcomes you to organise and run your own workshop. This means you are already connected with our [certified instructors][carpentries_instructors] and will work with them on all aspects of workshop organisation. When planning a Self-Organised workshop we ask that you complete the [self organized workshop notification form][self_org_notification_form] to notify us of your planned workshop so that we can [add your workshop to our website][workshops_upcoming], and provide support (in the form of survey result links and AMI instances for Genomics workshops) for your workshop. To learn more about the process for organising a workshop please review the [Workshop Checklist][workshop_checklist].
