[Carpentries workshops]({% link pages/workshops.html %}) teach researchers the skills and perspectives
to work more effectively and reproducibily with data and software. Our
workshops use open, collaboratively developed [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/), and [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/) lessons with materials on topics from data organisation to version contrtrol. All our workshops are taught by volunteer instructors, and we have more than 1,400
volunteer instructors around the world.

Becoming an instructor with The Carpentries connects you with a global
community of instructors who are passionate about helping others learn to
code and work with data. We use educational pedagogy to inform our teaching
practices and create accessible and inclusive workshops, including using a [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html), that promotes learning for all participants.



We offer [instructor training](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/index.html) to train people in how to teach Carpentries workshops, including educational pedagogy and Carpentries-specific information.
