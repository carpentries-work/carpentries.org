All participants are required to abide by <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/index_coc.html">The Carpentries Code of Conduct</a>. </p>

<h3><i class="far fa-money-bill-alt"></i> Workshop Cost</h3>

<br>

Our instructors are volunteers, and so are not paid for their teaching, but host sites are <b>required to cover travel and accommodation costs for any instructors</b>.

<ul>
<li>The total cost of hosting a workshop is both the Workshop Administration Fee and travel expenses for the two instructors.</li>
<li>This fee is used to support staff time with this partnership. You will be provided with exceptional customer service and timely support from our Workshop Administration Team and Regional Coordinators. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Workshop Administration Fee (Government and non-profit institutions):</h4>
<ul>
  <li>$2500 US</li>
  <li>The Carpentries staff will recruit instructors to teach your workshop and will assist with managing registration, if needed. </li>
  <li>To keep workshops accessible, The Carpentries will take responsibility for standard fees that arise due to an organisation’s location outside of the US. We see this as good business practice within a global community.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Workshop Administration Fee (For Profit):</h4>
<p>For information on fees for for-profit organisations, please <a href="mailto:team@carpentries.org">contact us</a>. 50% of workshop coordination fees for for-profit organisations go towards supporting workshops in areas with financial need. </p>

<p>
All invoices will be issued by <a href="https://communityin.org/">Community Initiatives</a>, our fiscal sponsor. The Carpentries staff will work with host sites to manage the invoicing process.
</p>


<h4>Workshop Administration Scholarship</h4>
<p>Scholarships may be available for workshops that reach new or under-served communities. If you are interested in hosting and would like to request assistance covering the fee, please complete the <a href="#">Workshop Request Form</a>. Select the option “I am requesting a scholarship to waive the administrative fee” and answer the required questions. If a scholarship is awarded, the host will still be responsible for the instructor travel expenses. </p>

<h4>Travel Expenses for Instructors:</h4>
All Instructors are volunteers, but the Host needs to cover their travel expenses. We work to find local instructors, but suggest that you estimate about $2000 total ($1000 per Instructor) for the travel, food, and accommodation of the instructors. The details of how you will reimburse the instructors need to be established when the workshop is scheduled. <b>The Carpentries is not involved in this process.</b>

<h3><i class="fas fa-tasks"></i> Organising a Workshop</h3>

<br>

<p>The Carpentries offers two types of workshops: <b>Centrally-Organised</b> and <b>Self-Organised</b>.</p>



<h4>Requesting a Centrally-Organised Workshop</h4>
<br>
<p>
Workshops are organised by The Carpentries Workshop Administration team for a <a href="#workshop-cost">fee</a>. The <a href="{% link pages/regional_coordinators.html %}">Regional Coordinator</a> for your region will assist with locating and coordinating instructors for the workshop. We ask that you request Centrally-Organised workshops at least 2-3 months before your desired workshop date. To learn more about the process for organising a workshop please review the  <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html">Workshop Checklist</a>.

</div>


<h4>Notification of a Self-Organised Workshop</h4>
<br>
<p>
The Carpentries welcomes you to organise and run your own workshop. This means you are already connected with our <a href="{%link pages/instructors.html%}">certified Instructors</a> and will work with them on all aspects of workshop organisation. When planning a Self-Organised workshop we ask that you complete the self organised workshop notification form to notify us of your planned workshop so that we can <a href="{%link pages/upcoming_workshops.html%}">add your workshop to our website</a> and provide support (in the form of survey result links and AMI instances for Genomics workshops) for your workshop. To learn more about the process for organising a workshop please review the  <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html">Workshop Checklist</a>. There is no fee due to The Carpentries for running a self-organised workshop.
